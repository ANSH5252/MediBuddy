        <h2>🚀 Building MediBuddy – My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            MediBuddy began as a simple idea: <em>“Can AI help predict diseases faster and more accurately?”</em>  
            Over time, it grew into a full-fledged health companion web application.
            I worked extensively with datasets containing symptoms, severities, precautions, diets, workouts, and medications.  
            Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested — <strong>Random Forest</strong>, <strong>XGBoost</strong>, <strong>Naive Bayes</strong>, and more — 
            but the <strong>Support Vector Classifier (SVC)</strong> consistently produced the most reliable predictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The challenge was not just in achieving high accuracy but also in ensuring that the model could handle incomplete or vague symptom inputs.
            Data preprocessing, missing value handling, and symptom mapping were critical steps.  
            On the frontend, I built a clean and intuitive UI using <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to ensure easy navigation for users of all ages.

        <h2>🌟 Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout development, I learned that building AI applications isn’t just about training a model —  
            it’s about understanding the problem deeply, preparing the right data, and ensuring the end product is user-friendly.  
            I also realized the importance of iteratively testing models and collecting user feedback to refine the experience.
