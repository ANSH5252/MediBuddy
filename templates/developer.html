        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m <strong>Anshuman Dash</strong>, a passionate learner and aspiring AI & Machine Learning engineer.  
            My goal is to create impactful technology that makes everyday life easier, healthier, and more connected.  
            MediBuddy is one of my favorite projects because it blends <em>machine learning</em>, <em>data analysis</em>, and <em>user experience design</em> into something meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading about the latest AI breakthroughs,  
            experimenting with new datasets, or exploring innovative ways to apply technology in healthcare.
